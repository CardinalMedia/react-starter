# React-Starter :fire:

Boilerplate with React, Redux, React-Router, and Axios, based on [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)/

## CLI

* `npm start` to run app in development
* `npm test` to run tests
* `npm run build` to build for production

## Notes

* .scss files may be required imported into components (where they will be scoped) or imported in `main.scss` (where they will be global).
* A reducer for `react-router` is provided, but this is the only instance of Redux being used. Examples for components showing local state are provided.
* Set REST API in `/src/config.json`.
